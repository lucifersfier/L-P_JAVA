public class HelloJava {
    // Main is the entry point of a java application This is where java starts running code.
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");  // Print "Hello World!" to the console
    }
}

/*when you execute your code, java looks for the entry point, it looks for main tries to find it 
and once it does, its going to run the code inside */
