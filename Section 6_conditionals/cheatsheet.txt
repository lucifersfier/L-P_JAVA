Cheat Sheet
This cheat sheet contains takeaways leading up to section three.
1. Getting Started
class: contains all of your code.
main(): entry point of your app.
javac <file-name>.java: compiles your code.
java <file-name>: runs the compiled code.

2. Variables
Data types
There are 6 main data types.

    data type           value
    int                 whole numbers
    long                Very large whole numbers
    double              Decimals
    String              Text
    char                A single character
    boolean             true or false

long can store very big numbers. But, int is faster and takes less memory.

int         4 bytes
long        8 bytes

Math Operators
+ =  plus
- = Minus
* = Multiply
/ = Division (not an integer division)
% = Modulus - returns remainder after division
++ = Increment by one
-- = Decrement by one
+= Add by
-= Subtract by

Put math operations in brackets if you wish to embed them inside a String.
Example: "5 + 2 is " + (5 + 2);

3. Booleans and Conditionals
Comparison Operators

Comparison          name
>                   greater than
<                   smaller than
>=                  greater than equal to
<=                  smaller than equal to
==                  equal to
!=                  not equal to
equals              equal to (string)
!equals            not equal to (string)

Put comparison operations in brackets if you wish to embed them inside a String.
Example: "Five is not smaller than one. I'm certain this is " + (5 < 1);

Rules of thumb
When controlling how your code runs:
use switch to compare one value against a list of values.
in any other scenario, use if-else.

Do not confuse = with ==
use = to set a value equal to another.
use == to compare two values and return a boolean.

Scanner

Method          Skips delimiter?        returns
nextLine()      no                      the nextLine
nextInt()       yes                     the next int
nextDouble()    yes                     the next double
nextLong()      yes                     the next long
next()          yes                     the next string



The default delimiter is white space.
Coding Pitfalls

TRAP: putting nextLine() ahead of nextInt,nextDouble, nextLong and next()
PITFALL: nextLine() is wasted by reading an empty file
SOLUTION: add a throwaway nextLine before the real nextLine


Good coding habits
Conventions
class: CamelCase.
variable: lowerCamelCase.

Tips and tricks
Terminal
Use the up key to run previous terminal commands.
Write clear to clear the terminal output.
Press the tab key for auto-complete.

Escape characters
\n adds a new line of space.
\t adds a new tab of space.

Shortcut keys
Use CMD/Ctrl+/ to comment a highlighted piece of code.
In Visual Studio Code, use sysout as a shortcut to System.out.println()
